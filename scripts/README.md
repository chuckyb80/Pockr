# Scripts

> **Rule: Docker only.** Every download, build, and test runs inside a Docker container.
> The only tool required on the host is **Docker Desktop**.

## Active scripts

| Script | What it does | When to run |
|---|---|---|
| `build_apk.sh` | Builds the Flutter Android APK inside an Ubuntu/JDK/Flutter Docker container | Every code change |
| `build_alpine_base.sh` | Builds the Alpine base QCOW2 image (Docker + Python pre-installed) | When `guest/` files change |
| `alpine_build_inner.sh` | Inner build logic invoked by `build_alpine_base.sh` inside the Alpine container | Called automatically — do not run directly |
| `firebase_test.sh` | Submits APK to Firebase Test Lab for Robo test on Pixel2.arm (Android 11) | After each APK build |

---

## `build_apk.sh`

```bash
./scripts/build_apk.sh          # debug build (default)
./scripts/build_apk.sh release  # release build
```

Builds a `docker-app-builder` Docker image (Ubuntu 22.04 + JDK 17 + Android SDK + Flutter 3.22.2) on first run (~10 min), then runs the Flutter build inside it.

**Output:** `build/docker-vm-debug.apk` or `build/docker-vm-release.apk` (~220 MB debug)

**Builder image is cached** — subsequent builds take ~2–3 minutes.

### Signing

| Build | Signed with | Why |
|---|---|---|
| debug | `android/app/debug.keystore` (committed) | Stable signature, so `adb install -r` upgrades in place. The key is public. |
| release | Your release keystore, **outside the repo** | A public key must never sign something users install. |

A release build refuses to run without the release key. It never falls back to `debug.keystore`.

```bash
./scripts/make_release_keystore.sh        # once; writes ~/.pockr/release.keystore (alias: pockr)

export POCKR_KEYSTORE_FILE=$HOME/.pockr/release.keystore
export POCKR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=...        # set from your password manager, not typed inline
export POCKR_KEY_PASSWORD=...
export POCKR_KEY_ALIAS=pockr
./scripts/build_apk.sh release
```

Back up the keystore and both passwords. Android only installs an update signed with the same key, so a lost
keystore strands every existing install. For a non-Docker Gradle build, put `storeFile`, `storePassword`,
`keyAlias` and `keyPassword` in `android/key.properties` (gitignored) instead of the environment.

Releases published before this change were signed with the debug key. Installs of those need one uninstall and
reinstall to move to the release key.

## `build_alpine_base.sh`

```bash
./scripts/build_alpine_base.sh
```

Builds a custom Alpine Linux 3.19 (aarch64) root filesystem with:
- Docker CE pre-installed and configured (iptables=false, bridge=none for virt kernel)
- Python 3 + FastAPI + uvicorn + pydantic pre-installed
- `api_server.py`, `init_bootstrap.sh` baked in from `guest/`
- DNS configured with fallback servers and `options use-vc` (TCP-forced DNS)
- Converts to QCOW2 and gzips the result

**Output:** `android/app/src/main/assets/vm/base.qcow2.gz` (~102 MB)

**Re-run when:** `guest/api_server.py`, `guest/init_bootstrap.sh`, or `guest/requirements.txt` change.

After rebuilding the base image, also bump the extraction marker in `VmManager.kt`:
```kotlin
// Change the version suffix in assetsReady() and extractAssets():
File(filesDir, "assets_extracted.vN")  // increment N
```

## `firebase_test.sh`

```bash
./scripts/firebase_test.sh <your-gcp-project> Pixel2.arm 30
```

Arguments: `<project-id> <device-model> <android-api-level>`

Requires `service-account-key.json` in the project root (Firebase service account, gitignored).

**Test device:** Pixel2.arm — ARM64 physical device, Android 11 (API 30)
**GCS bucket:** `<your-gcs-bucket>` (shown in test output)

Download logcat after test:
```bash
gsutil cp "gs://<your-gcs-bucket>/<run-id>/Pixel2.arm-30-en-portrait/logcat" /tmp/logcat.txt
```

## Legacy scripts (not part of current workflow)

These scripts were used during initial setup. QEMU binaries are now committed in `jniLibs/` and the base image is built via `build_alpine_base.sh`, so these are no longer needed for normal development.

| Script | Original purpose |
|---|---|
| `download_alpine.sh` | Download Alpine ISO and convert to QCOW2 |
| `extract_from_termux.sh` | Extract QEMU binaries from Termux `.deb` packages |
| `build_qemu.sh` | Cross-compile QEMU from source for Android ARM64 |
| `setup_assets.sh` | Interactive menu for the above scripts |
| `copy_bootstrap.sh` | Copy `guest/` scripts into `assets/bootstrap/` |
| `verify_assets.sh` | Validate assets before APK build |
| `generate_checksums.sh` | SHA-256 checksums for assets |
| `test_api.sh` | Test `api_server.py` end-to-end with Docker-in-Docker |
